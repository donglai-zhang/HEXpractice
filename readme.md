DistrubutedHEX:
  Some key notes
    1 The convective coefficient in the shell side is calculated in the same way as tube side (by Nu), instead of the Bell-Delaware method.
    2 Some coefficients, e.g., heat capacity, conductivity, are supposed constant at this stage.

  Steps:
    1 Initialisation:
      -Initialise HEX, e.g., inner/outer radius, conductivity, etc.
      -Initialise fluids, e.g., physical properties, Reynolds, convective coefficients, etc.
      -Initialise fouling, deposit thickness = 0.
    2 Run data at t = 0.
    3 update parameters:
      -Update deposit layers.
      -Update HEX and fluid parameters dependent on fouling layer.
    4 Run recursively and monitor the first 10000 secs.
    5 Reset initial conditions to ambient temperature (300K) when one day passes.
    6 Obseve the starting time of psudo steady state changing each day, buy finding where dQdt(t - 1) > eps and dQdt(t) < eps.
