DistrubutedHEX:
  Some key notes
    1 The convective coefficient in the shell side is calculated in the same way as tube side (by Nu), instead of the Bell-Delaware method.
    2 The deposit layers are still half lumped, hence I simply used the measured temperature to replace the film temperature.
    3 Some coefficients, e.g., heat capacity, conductivity, are supposed constant at this stage.

  Steps:
    1 Initialisation:
      -Initialise HEX, e.g., inner/outer radius, conductivity, etc.
      -Initialise fluids, e.g., physical properties, Reynolds, convective coefficients, etc.
      -Initialise fouling, fouling resitance = 0, deposit thickness = 0.
    2 Run data at t = 0.
    3 update parameters:
      -Update deposit layers.
      -Update HEX and fluid parameters dependent on fouling layer.
    4 Run recursively.
